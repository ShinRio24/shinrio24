## 🚀 About Me

I am passionate about building AI-driven solutions for creative media and education. As the founder of **MangaAI**, I’m developing cutting-edge platforms that transform manga into interactive video experiences using OCR, character recognition, and large language models. My work in comics character recognition has set new benchmarks, and I love tackling algorithmic challenges, as shown by my achievements in national and international informatics competitions.
